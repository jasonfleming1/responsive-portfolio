            <p>Jason Fleming is a Business Systems Analyst at Rust Consulting, Inc. I've spent the past 3 years
                architecting, configuring, and implementing a cross-functional, process-driven enterprise request
                management system that facilitates 30,000 service requests annually. I perform project management,
                business architecture, system architecture, system engineer, and training/support roles on a daily
                basis.</p>

            <p>The initial system rollout in 2015 was a two week effort including 5 teams in separate departments
                across the organization. As of January 2019 the system provides 67 unique services that fulfill their
                client's business needs and meet the demands of external auditors. I'm driven by delivering solutions
                that increases productivity, communication clarity, and work experience. </p>
            <p>I live in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis with my partner, Maren, and our amazing daughter,
                Sydney. I play synthesizer and bass guitar, occassionally out in the seedy underbelly of downtown
                Minneapolis. I enjoy music, art, thinking, and family. </p>
